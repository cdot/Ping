 * Location sampling, provides location data to LoggingService.

 * For apps running in the background on "O" devices, location is computed only once every 10
 * minutes and delivered batched every 30 minutes. This restriction applies even to apps
 * targeting "N" or lower which are run on "O" devices. So a background service will only log
 * samples every 30 minutes, which is useless for Ping. LoggingService puts itself into
 * foreground using a Notification, so is able to keep sampling at a foreground rate.
 * <p>
 * Note that this Sampler doesn't log it's own samples, instead it is used to watermark samples
 * coming from the SonarSampler with the location.
